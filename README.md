# Ansible Tasker

<p><a href="https://github.com/ansible">Ansible</a> is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration-management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task-execution, and multinode orchestration - including trivializing things like zero downtime rolling updates with load balancers.</p>
<p>And this is extremely simple web-admin panel for it designed for launching playbooks from browser. As example it configured for setup BOSH/Cloud Foundry/Redis. Feel free to post suggestions/bugs.</p>
